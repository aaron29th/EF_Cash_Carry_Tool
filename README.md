# EF_Cash_Carry_Tool
Seeing inefficiencies in printing picks, just for
- Customer information to be retyped into Word for labels
- Customer information being manually copied onto pick sheets
- Pick totals being manually calculated with a calculator

This proof of concept tool:
1. Intercepts pick print jobs as pdfs
2. Parses all relevant information from the pdfs
3. Prints the pick, its front sheet and labels with all details filled in and in order
4. Allows the totals and averages about the pick to be easily copied to an excel document for performance tracking
